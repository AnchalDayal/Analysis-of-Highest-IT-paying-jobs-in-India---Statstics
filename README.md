# **Analysis of Highest IT Paying Jobs in India**

## **About Dataset**

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Position**: The job title or role of the employee.
- **Location**: The city or area where the employee is based.
- **Gender**: The gender of the employee.
- **Education**: The educational qualification of the employee.
- **Experience (Years)**: The number of years of experience the employee has.
- **Salary**: The salary of the employee.
- **Experience Level**: The experience level (e.g., "8+ years").

## **Objective**

The objective of this project is to analyze a dataset containing employee data in the IT sector. The analysis will focus on job positions, locations, salaries, educational qualifications, and experience levels.

## **Questions**

### Basic-Level Questions
1. How many unique job positions are listed in the dataset?
2. What is the average salary of IT jobs in India?
3. Which location has the highest number of job positions listed?

### Intermediate-Level Questions
1. Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the salaries in the dataset. Which measure (mean, median, or mode) best represents the central tendency of the salaries?
2. Find the range and interquartile range (IQR) of the experience (years) in the dataset. How do these values help in understanding the spread of experience across the employees?
3. Calculate the variance and standard deviation for the salaries of employees with different levels of education (e.g., Bachelor's, Master's, Ph.D.). What does the standard deviation indicate about the spread of salaries within each education group?
4. Determine the correlation between experience (years) and salary. Is there a positive, negative, or no correlation between these variables?
5. Plot the distribution of salaries. Is the distribution positively or negatively skewed? What does this indicate about the salary structure in the IT industry in India?
6. What is the median salary based on different levels of experience (e.g., 0-3 years, 4-7 years, 8+ years)?
